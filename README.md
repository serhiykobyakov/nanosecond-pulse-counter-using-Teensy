# Short pulse counter for photon counting using Teensy 4.0

## Goal
There is a need for short TTL pulses counter with the following requirements:
* input: 5V, 10ns wide square pulses, there are already established signal line using BNC cable from amplifier-discriminator to receiver (receiver has 50 Ohm input)
* counter must be able to count pulses in measuring intervals from 0.05 to 4 seconds
* counter must release warning sound when measuring signal exceed certain allowed value
* communication with PC via USB port

## One step at a time

OK, let's clarify the numbers:

Input signal is (according to Hamamatsu C9744 PHOTON COUNTING UNIT, which is actually preamplifier-discriminator (shame, Hamamatsu, shame!)):

- 5V TTL
- single pulse width 10 ns
- max pulse repetition (linear range): 4Â·10<sup>6</sup> pulses per second
